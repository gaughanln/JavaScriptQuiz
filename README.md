# JavaScriptQuiz

## Description

I've created a timed quiz on JavaScript basics. Participants will be asked a series of questions with a 10 minute timer. For every wrong answer, 30 seconds will be taken off the clock. The quiz is over when the particpant has completed it or ran out of time. The participant will be able to enter their initials next to their score and reference their past high scores. 

#### Criteria:

* Create a dynamic HTML and CSS style sheet
*
